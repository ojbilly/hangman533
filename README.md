## Description
The **Fruit Guessing Game** is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates how to work with:
- Python lists to store a collection of data (e.g., fruit names),
- The `random` module to randomly select items from a list,
- User input validation using conditional statements (`if-else`).

### What It Does
- Prompts the user to enter a single letter.
- Validates the input to ensure it is exactly one alphabetical character.
- Provides feedback on the validity of the input.

### Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to:
- Practice basic Python concepts such as lists, user input, and conditional statements.
- Learn how to validate user input.
- Familiarize yourself with the process of creating a simple interactive script.

### What I Learned
- How to use Pythonâ€™s `random.choice` to randomly select an item from a list.
- How to validate user input with `len()` and `.isalpha()`.
- How to structure Python code for readability and functionality.
