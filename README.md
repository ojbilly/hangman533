## Description

### Fruit Guessing Game

The **Fruit Guessing Game** (implemented in `milestone_2.py`) is a beginner-friendly Python project designed to demonstrate:

- How to work with Python lists to store a collection of data (e.g., fruit names).
- Using the `random` module to select a random item from a list.
- Validating user input with Python's built-in functions.

**What It Does**:

- Prompts the user to enter a single letter.
- Validates the input to ensure it is exactly one alphabetical character.
- Provides feedback on the validity of the input.

**Aim of the Project**:

- Practice Python basics like lists, loops, and input validation.
- Build a foundational understanding of user interaction in Python.

### Word Guessing Game

The **Word Guessing Game** (implemented in `milestone_3.py`) is an interactive game where the user must guess a letter in a predefined word.

**What It Does**:

- Continuously prompts the user to guess a letter until they enter valid input.
- Validates the input to ensure it is a single alphabetical character.
- Checks if the guessed letter is in the word and provides appropriate feedback.

**Aim of the Project**:

- Understand modular programming by splitting logic into reusable functions (`check_guess` and `ask_for_input`).
- Practice validation and conditionals for user input.
- Learn how to check for the presence of characters in strings.

**What I Learned from Both Projects**:

- How to use Pythonâ€™s `random.choice` to select items from a list.
- Effective input validation using `len()` and `.isalpha()`.
- How to create and call functions for modular programming.
- Structuring Python scripts for readability and reusability.
