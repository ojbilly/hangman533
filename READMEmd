## Description

The **Hangman Game** is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates how to:

- Use classes to encapsulate game logic.
- Handle user input validation.
- Implement a simple game loop with winning and losing conditions.

### What It Does

- Initializes the game with a word ("pearl") to be guessed.
- Prompts the user to guess one letter at a time.
- Validates the input to ensure it is a single alphabetical character.
- Updates the game state based on correct or incorrect guesses.
- Ends the game when the word is fully guessed or the player runs out of lives.

### Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to:

- Practice Python programming concepts such as classes, loops, and input validation.
- Understand modular programming by splitting functionality into reusable methods.
- Build a simple yet engaging console-based game.

### What I Learned

- How to use classes and methods effectively to structure a project.
- Input validation techniques for interactive programs.
- How to build a game loop with user-defined end conditions.
